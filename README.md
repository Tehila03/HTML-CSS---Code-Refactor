# Horiseon Marketing Home Page
**HTML CSS - Code Refactor**

This project aimed to refactor Horiseon's existing web application in an effort to increase accessibility for users. The addition of alt text allows users with disabilities or impairments to access the website using assistive technologies. The inclusion of semantic elements, as well as the restructuring and consolidation of elements within our code aids in the long-term sustainability and efficiency of the codebase.
